# The Subjivala App
This app is like direct way to help our vendors in current time of Covid-19 what we are projecting here is 
The Application with have two Login Setups (1) For Vendors (2) For Buyer .

This is application will only reqried your location access and Society Name.(Don't require the exact name of Buyer and his address)

How its is different?
This application helps the local cart vendors in city with current most requriemnts of people demands.

In Buyers page we will have all the Vegetable and fruits listed they will select all they like to have and request it.

This request is then transfromed in API Call to directly all the Vendors in 20Km radius of that request location.[Max Loc -20Km [2,5,10,15,20]](Like Tinder)

What will happen all the mutiple request are made this will help the vendor decide what to buy form Whole Seller so they can reduce the waste .

And those cluster most area location is project to the vendors in Map /List (In Society Name) Were they can roam and sell the their product with ease.

This project main vision is to minimise the waste of Local Vendors who are already making very less in their life. 

If you want to contribute in this project development(Yes , we want Full Stack Devs and Data Science Dev) who can helps in bulding foundation of thi projects.
